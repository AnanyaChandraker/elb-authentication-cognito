# ** Build a website that requires user to authenticate with AWS ELB/Cognito **

## **Overview**
In this lab we, you will be building a website where users need to be authenticate before accessing the content using Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB)  and integrating with Amazon Cognito. AWS ALB provides authentication through social Identity Providers (IdP) which will be Amazon  Cognito. In this lab, we will have a public website available to everyone, and an other page only visible for authenticated users. If users tries to access this page,ALB redirects them to Cognito which will handle the Login and redirect them back to your ALB to access the restricted content. 


## **Architecture**

## ** Login Page Website ** ##

After deploying the solution, you will have a website hosted behind your ALB. This website shows a login page that will use Cognito integrated with ALB.

Once the user click on the Login button, it gets redirected to the Cognito Login page and once logged in, the user gets redirected back to the ALB with a code. ALB will then communicate with Cognito to verify and validate the user based on the code. Once the validation passed, ALB will eventually redirect the user to the original request and give an authentication cookie (step 4 in the diagram above) that will be used for any authenticated subsequent requests.

## **Walkthrough**
1. Configure Cognito User pool
2. Congigure Authentication rule on ALB

### **Configure Cognito User pool**

Web developers want to use federated identities from social networks to allow their users to sign-in. ALBâ€™s new authentication action provides authentication through social Identity Providers (IdP) like Google, Facebook, and Amazon through Amazon Cognito.
We will use Cognito to act as an identity provider (IdP) which will authenticate users through the user pools supported by Amazon Cognito. 

1. Open the Amazon Cognito Console in Asia Pacific(Sydney) Region at https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/
2. Click on Manage User Pools and select the User Pool created by the CloudFormation Template "ELBDevlabs-user-pool". A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito and we will refer to this when we will configure the Authentication on the Load Balancer.

3. Create user in the Users and groups navigation pane and fill out the user form (you can choose either phone or email). This where all the Users related information will be stored

4. After you create a user pool, you can create an app to use the built-in webpages for signing up and signing in your users.

Configure the App client settings from the App integration navigation pane :

  a. Select "Cognito User Pool"
  
  b. Configure the callback URL(s) l: https://yourdomain.com/oauth2/idpresponse
  
This tells Cognito where to redirect the User once authenticated, Cognito needs to redirect the authenticated user back to the LoadBalancer. Your Application Load Balancer (ALB) was created as part of a template and a DNS Alias record was created using a custom domain name. Please ask your instructor to know what is the domain name of your ALB. 

If your ALB DNS name is elbdevlabs.yecine.myinstance.com, the callback URL(s) will be : https://elbdevlabs.yecine.myinstance.com/oauth2/idpresponse 
  
  c. Allowed  OAuth Flows: Authorization code grant
  
  d. Allowed OAuth Scopes : openid
  
  e. Save changes

5. Configure the Domain name for your Cogntio endpoint and check its availability with the "Check availability" button, then hit "Save changes". You can choose any Domain name as long as it is unique. In the example below I was using "elbdevlabs"

![Domain](https://customsolutions.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Yecine-Devlab/Screen+Shot+2020-02-24+at+3.39.18+PM.png)

At this stage, we have an IdP configured with a user. This IdP will be used by ALB to force your user to login and to allow ALB to validate and verify your user access as part of the authentication flow. Now we need to configure ALB to authenticate the clients browsing to the website.


### **Configure ALB Authentication rule**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 Console in Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region at https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
2. Select the Load Balancers menu from the navigation pane
3. Select the Load Balancer that was created as part of the CloudFormation template 
4. At the bottom, select the Listener Tab and select the "View/Edit rules"

5. We will add a new Path based rule, which will be matched when the user click on the "Login" button. This button redirects the user to the /users/users.html page. We need to configure a rule to authenticate the users when this Path is used. 

  a. Click on the "+" button at the top to insert a rule 
  
  ![AddPathRule](https://customsolutions.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Yecine-Devlab/Screen+Shot+2020-04-13+at+3.46.44+PM.png)
  
  b. Under the Conidtion (IF), Click on the "+ Add condition" to select Path and use the "/users/*" path. 
  
  ![Path](https://customsolutions.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Yecine-Devlab/Screen+Shot+2020-04-13+at+5.57.29+PM.png)
  
  c. Under the Action (THEN), add an action : AUTHENTICATE and refer to the Cognito User pool ID (It should be visible from the drop down list)
  
![Forward](https://customsolutions.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Yecine-Devlab/Screen+Shot+2020-04-13+at+3.50.11+PM.png)
  
  d. We need to add an action once the user is authenticated, the action will be FORWARD to forward to the Target group where our Instance is running the website (it should be visible from the drop down list) 
  

 ![UserpoolID](https://customsolutions.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Yecine-Devlab/Screen+Shot+2020-04-13+at+3.50.11+PM.png)

6. Select Amazon Cognito and choose the Pool Id that we configured previously 
7. Select App Client we configured (there should only one App Client)
8. Leave by default the other parameters and click on the Validation Box

![CognitoPool](https://customsolutions.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Yecine-Devlab/Screen+Shot+2020-02-24+at+3.47.11+PM.png)

9. After the first Authenticate rule, add a new action "Forward to" and select the Target group that was created as part of CloudFormation 

![Vali](https://customsolutions.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Yecine-Devlab/Screen+Shot+2020-02-24+at+3.48.02+PM.png)

10. Validate the settings and click on the Update button
